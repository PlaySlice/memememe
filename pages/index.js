              MEMESOL is the token that will either make you a millionaire or leave you crying in a corner. It's a gamble, a meme, a lifestyle. We're not sure what it is either, but we're here for it!

              We have a total supply of... uh... a lot. Like, a REALLY big number. We're talking astronomical. We're not even sure how many zeros there are, but who cares? More zeros = more gains, right?

              <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> INFINITE (probably)</li>

              <li>Make everyone rich (or at least have a good laugh trying)</li>
